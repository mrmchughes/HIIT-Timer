# HIIT-Timer
A HIIT Interval Timer, intially based off of http://kellylougheed.com/blog/a-javascript-timer-for-hiit-workouts/.

Use the two input fields to select your workout intervals. The Set button will then lock in the intervals you have selected. 
The Start button will start your workout on a working interval, the Pause button will pause your workout, and the Reset button will reset the app.
The background color of this page will change, to reflect on if you are on a rest or a working period.
